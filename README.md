# StockMe
A stock notification web app created for learning purposes with Svelte and Tailwind.

Created it for fun during the GME stock craze to learn about Svelte, Tailwind, Chartjs and Pushjs.

The app uses Push.js to send push notifications and Chart.js to display a line graph of the current price of the stock over the course of a day.

I was planning on adding a real backend using gRPC but browser compatability with gRPC was very finicky so I went with web sockets instead using python and the Alpaca stocks API.
