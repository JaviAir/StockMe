user send request for symbol price 
    by sending symbol to my websocket server,

if userSymbol in a storedStockPrice map:
    respond with symbol value aka price

else if usersymbol is not in the map, 
    make a get request or puppeteer for initial value
    then add it to map
    then start listening for it
